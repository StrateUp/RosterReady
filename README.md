# RosterReady

### Synopsis
***
Our app is designed as a hub for teams needing players and players ready to play, to connect and fill the team rosters in realtime. 
Life happens and people can’t always make their team commitments, but Roster Ready makes it easy for that team to reach out to a community of participants that can help fill their need. 
People that are interested in playing, deciding ‘day-of’ availability, can find teams needing players at a moment’s notice. And show up to essentially ‘save the day’.
